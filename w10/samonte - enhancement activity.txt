<h1>Bistek Tagalog</h1>
<h2><em>Bistek Tagalog is a type of Filipino beef stew. It's also known as Beef steak to a few. It has a lot of onions and is made<br>
with thin beef slices.. These are stewed in a soy sauce and lemon juice mixture until the beef gets extremely tender. It tastes the<br>
best with heated rice.</em></h2>
<h3><em><b>Bistek</b> Comparison:</em></h3>
<p><em>There are a few recipes which use lemons instead of calamansi, like Kawaling Pinoy's <b>Bistek</b> recipe. There are also some which use<br>
calamansi, like Panlasang Pinoy's <b>Bistek</b> recipe. There's also a slight difference with the amount of meat used- which also leads to<br>
different cook times. Also preparation times, because it depends which recipe you look at for the amount of time you marinate<br>
your beef. The preparation can also vary depending on which recipe you check. For example, in Kawaling Pinoy's <b>Bistek</b> recipe, the second<br>
step is to remove meat, onions, and garlic from the marinade- unlike in Panlasang Pinoy's <b>Bistek</b> recipe where you only marinate your beef<br>
in soy sauce, calamansi, and ground black pepper. Or another example would be in Panlasang Pinoy's <b>Bistek</b> recipe, you fry half of the onions<br>
and then remove them from the pan, then saute the garlic and remaining half of your onions- before pouring your remaining marinade and water.<br>
Meanwhile, in Kawaling Pinoy's <b>Bistek</b> recipe, you have to saute the beef, then take it out of the pan before you saute the onions and garlic.<br></em></p>
<h3 style="color:red">Versions of <b>Bistek</b>: <b>Bistek</b> with Potatoes</h3>
<p><em><b>Bistek</b> with Potatoes only has one difference, which is already mentioned in the title- potatoes. There are a few websites<br>
which have this recipe, like Riverten Kitchen's <b>Bistek</b> with Potatoes recipe. Or Casa Baluarte's <b>Bistek</b> with Fried Potatoes<br>
recipe.</em></p>
