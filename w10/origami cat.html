<p>Depending on the difficulty level, origami cats can be either very easy to both decorate<br>
and create, or they can be extremely difficult to even finish. So, let's attempt to create one!</p>
<p>Materials:</p>
<ul>
       <li>Origami paper
       <li>A pencil (if you need to mark the folding spots)
</ul>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
     <li>Fold your origami paper in half [fold the left corner to the right corner]. Unfold.
     <li>Fold the upper left and right sides to the center.
     <li>Now fold the bottom left and right sides to the center.
     <li>Fold in half by folding the bottom corner to the top.
     <li>Fold most [not all] of the flap back down.
     <li>Open the pocket on the left side and squash down while folding the left side of the triangle to the center. Do the same to the right side.
     <li>Fold the figure in half by folding the right side to the left.
     <li>Fold the thin triangle to the right. This is the tail.
     <li>Unfold the tail.
     <li>Outside reverse fold the tail. Open the figure and bend the tail up along the creases you just made. Close the figure and crease the sides in.
     <li>Fold the bottom corner up, make sure the base lines up with the base of the tail. Do the same for the other side.
     <li>Open up the body and fold the top.
     <li>Fold the flap up and flatten well.
     <li>Open the top flap, fold down, and crease the sides. Turn the figure over.
     <li>Fold the corners of the "neck." Turn the figure over again.
     <li>Push in the middle of the top of the head and crease the front edges.
     <li>Fold the bottom corner of the face up to form the nose.
     <li>Unfold the feet a little so they're perpendicular with the floor.
     <li>Twirl the tail and you're done!
