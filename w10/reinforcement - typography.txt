<h1>Memories and Experiences</h1>
<p><b>My</b> highschool life has been chaotic and stressful. Sometimes I think: "I actually can't believe I'm doing this<br>
or that this is happening to me." I'm not normally someone who is outgoing with my classmates, but I've learned<br>
that having hangouts and actually trying to be friends with my class is really nice, I get to experience a lot.</p>
<p><em><u>I</u></em> remember that one time Lindsay, Joana, and I needed to get something printed for Filipino but we decided<br>
to print it at school. We went to get them printed by our ICT teacher, Sir Grafilon. I remember we were panicking<br>
and running around just to get them printed, and then as we were arranging the document, the bell rang. We panicked<br>
and made jokes about it and we were laughing and laughing because Joana still tried to make the message to Sir very normal,<br>
when in reality we were sweating in an air conditioned room, panicking because we thought we would be late.</p>
<p>There was also one time where we had to sing a song for our music performance task in front of our teacher, Ma'am Macabudbud.<br>
I remember hanging out at the stairs [on the 4th floor] practicing, and once we also went up to the court[?] and practiced there.<br>
Our hard work and many practices payed off, and we got a compliment from Ma'am Macabudbud saying our performance gave her chills!<br>
[Although we were not in any costumes, Joana did a really good job assigning parts to all of us.</p>
